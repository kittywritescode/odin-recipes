# Odin Recipes

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website.

Upon satisfying the bare minimal requirements for the website (having a
functional index page with links to at least 3 recipes), I have managed to
demonstrate the following set of skills:

* Understand basic files and directories management in web development
* Able to confidently write html documents using the most common and important 
html tags\/elements
* Overall having a solid grasp of the steps required to build a simple website

Due to my lack of experience with using git, I did not remember to commit often enough, only starting to do so halfway through the project. This explains the roughness and inconsistency of the first few commits.
